# github-contribution-scraper
## Purpose
Ever wanted your github contribution data in an object? No? Oh. Well if you did, I couldn't find a github API for it. Nevermatter, I wanted to learn web scraping anyway. 

This takes a GitHub user profile URL and scrapes the page for the contribution chart. It sticks this into a JS object for your personal use.

## Further
I intend to take this further in a future project with some customizable graphs. Will keep posted.
